#Illustration App

This app on SwiftUI uses animation

##Screens:
- the main screen at startup contains an image of paws that appear animatedly. The image of the paws is drawn in code using struct Path and Ellipse. The button also appears animated along with the paws. When tapping on the screen, the paws disappear animatedly. The text at the bottom of the screen changes depending on the display of paws.
